# In ruby there is no "let" or "const",
# Variables are declared using a single "="




greeting = 'hello'

greeting = 'how do you do'





# =========================================================

# To log something to the console we use "puts" followed by whatever we want to log
# run the page by typing ruby followed by the filename in terminal
# ex: ruby 0-syntax.rb




# puts greeting




# ==========================================================


# to declare a function we use "def" followed by the function name
# notice you must denote the end of a function with the word "end"

# number = 3

# def hello
#     if number < 4
#         puts 'less than 4'
#     end
# end



# We call functions the same way we do in Javascript




# hello()





# ============================================================



# We also use "end" to denote the closing of an "if-statement"



num = 5

if num > 3
    # puts 'more than 3'
end



# ============================================================

# One note about numbers and divisions
# notice how when we divide 5 by 2 we get back a whole number



# puts 5 / 2




# to remedy this we must add a decimal to convert the number to a float




puts 5 / 2.to_f
